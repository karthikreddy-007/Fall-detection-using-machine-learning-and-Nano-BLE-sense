 Fall Detection System Using Machine Learning and NanoBLE Sense

This project focuses on developing an efficient fall detection and assistance system for the elderly, combining machine learning and the Arduino Nano BLE Sense microcontroller. Leveraging built-in sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope), the system monitors movements in real-time to accurately detect falls and promptly notify caregivers or medical personnel. 

 Key Features:
- Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks movement patterns using sensor data for continuous fall detection.  
- Machine Learning Integration**: Employs ML models to distinguish falls from normal activities with high accuracy.  
- Low Power Consumption**: Powered by Arduino Nano BLE Sense for efficient operation in wearable applications.  
- Immediate Alerts**: Sends notifications with user location and status to designated contacts upon fall detection.  
- Health Insights**: Provides continuous health monitoring and analysis for proactive care.  

The project envisions future enhancements like advanced ML algorithms, IoT integration, and ergonomic wearable designs to further improve the safety and quality of life for elderly individuals.
